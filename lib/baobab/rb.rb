# The gem's conventional entry point, matching the "baobab-rb" gem name.
#
# `require "baobab"` (lib/baobab.rb) loads the actual application; this file
# exists so that requiring the gem by its own name resolves, and so
# spec/spec_helper.rb — which, by the house convention this fork's pilot port
# established, requires the gem under its own name — has something to load.
#
# It deliberately does not require_relative '../baobab' here: pulling in the
# application means pulling in every widget file, and every widget file
# requires 'adwaita', which needs a real or virtual display to initialise GTK.
# A spec that genuinely needs the application asks for 'application' (or any
# other lib/*.rb file) itself; this file only has to expose the gem's version.
